    <h2>Professional acknowledgments</h2>
    <p>
      First of all, I would like to thank Esther Elías Alonso, CEO and
      co-founder of
      <a href="https://www.funtechrocket.education/">FunTech Rocket</a>, for
      making my first professional interview possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to thank the manager of
      <a href="https://www.onlinehuelva.net/">Onlinehuelva</a> for his advice
      and his vision of the IT profession in Huelva.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to thank
      <a href="https://ventanasagroalimentarias.com/"
        >Ventanas Agroalimentarias</a
      >
      for helping me in my search for an internship by spreading the word about
      my application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last but not least, I would like to thank all my students. Their successes
      make me truly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these people give me the strength to keep working. The meritocratic
      path is demanding, but it is also more satisfying and better for society.
    </p>
    <h2>Personal and professional values</h2>
    <p>
      It is possible to earn money and do good for society. That is why I
      categorically refuse to work for companies that violate human rights:
      defense companies, political manipulation companies, companies involved in
      sexual exploitation, etc. My values cannot be bought.
